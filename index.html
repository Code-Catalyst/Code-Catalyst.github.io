        <p>The third season is set several months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, putting the majority of other local stores out of business due to the mall's popularity. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship and becomes very protective of his daughter. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory under Starcourt seeks to open the gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer uses mind control to make Billy do his bidding.

        <p>The fourth season is set several months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to Lenora, California for a fresh start. In California, Eleven struggles with the loss of her powers and being bullied in school. Meanwhile in Hawkins, a being from the Upside Down—an entity later dubbed Vecna—begins killing the residents of Hawkins, opening new gates between the two worlds in the process. Planning to stop Vecna, Dr. Sam Owens and Dr. Martin Brenner take Eleven to a facility to help her regain her powers. Meanwhile, Joyce and Murray fly to Russia to rescue Hopper from the Gulag in Kamchatka.

            <h1> The Vines </h1>

        <p>These vines are an extension of the Shadow Monster, and it uses the vines, the caverns, and the Demodogs to trap and kill many members of the Hawkins Lab. It seems the members of the Hawkins Lab were too blinded by science to realize that they were inviting some especially volatile creatures into their world.

Dart could ignore the Mind Flayer temporarily when he chose not to attack Dustin in the tunnels, recognizing him as a friend.

            <h1> The Demogorgon</h1>
        <p>The Demogorgon, also known as the Monster, was a predatory humanoid creature that entered Hawkins, Indiana in November 1983. The creature originated from the parallel dimension known as the Upside Down. When Eleven, a child test subject from Hawkins National Laboratory with psychokinetic abilities, made transdimensional contact with the creature, a gate between dimensions opened at the lab. The creature then set foot in Hawkins, and began hunting, killing and kidnapping various local townspeople.

            <h1> The Mind Flayer </h1>
        <p>The Mind Flayer is an entity originating from the Upside Down, an alternate dimension existing in parallel to the human world. The Mind Flayer is gigantic, looming at least 50 stories tall[1], and sports a distinctive spider-like appearance. The Mind Flayer could wield supreme control of the Upside Down via a psychic link, with Demogorgons, vines, and demobats forming a shared hive mind; for a period in 1985, possessed humans known as "The Flayed" would also comprise part of the hive mind. In a sense, the entirety of the Upside Down was like one gigantic organism, with all its contents and agents connected both physically and mentally via the Mind Flayer.

        <p>The big bad of Stranger Things season 4 is a humanoid monster with black skin and movable vines that protrude from his entire body. While he lives in the Upside Down, Vecna can psychically reach into the human world, kind of like the Mind Flayer's connection with Will. He makes his presence known in Hawkins by murdering the town's teenagers in a truly gruesome fashion, all through mental connections.
